- describe the broker connector protocol.

/*********************
 * Kasan constraints *
 *********************/

- need to disable MPU to access kasan attributes -> disable MPU kasan blacklist on entry.
	-> kasan calls to modify attributes must also use that
	-> one way is to cause a memfault at a registered location and check the PC.

- know the kernel executable layout 

- need the MPU enabled during ealry stages of boot to catch kasan calls.

- need the NVIC enabled during early stages of boot route to the correct handler

- Can't update SP in instruction emulation, as SP is not in the context switched registers.

- Can't write the stack in instruction emulation, as it may overwrite the context-save regs.


Kasan war stories to talk about : 
- forgot to push r4 before ldr r4, [sp] in kasan call
-> lead to some random memory corruption.

- how to format an interrupt handler properly for gdb to unwind correctly.
	-> adjust stack pointer on top.
	-> store registers
	-> avoid any weird sp op.
	-> after header, NEVER manipulate sp again.

- how to retrieve SP (read only)

- decoder :
  - arm spec is shit : 
    - fields are declared by iclass
    - encodings use the instruction class but add stuff
    - the encodings can partially define values 
      -> no consistency, sometimes 'x' sometimes ''.
      -> fields are grouped (imm3:imm2) by contiguous blocks.
    - there is _NO_ way to determine procedurally how compound values (const) are built.

  - we need to check for BOTH : 
    - knwon bits [01].
    - fields where at least one bit must differ ([SC] / [ZN] (seriously guys, Z/N, WFT, one means ZERO and the other NULL, what the fuck)

IT blocks : when we update the PC, we must also shift the IT flags in the saved CPSR.

MPU race condition with RBAR.RGN/VALID : SETS THE REGION BUT ALSO THE BASE ADDRESS.
-> WHEN DISABLING A REGION USING THIS METHOD, THIS UPDATES THE BASE ADDRESS OF THE PROTECTED REGION
	-> IF THE REGION IS A BLACKLIST, THERE IS A WINDOW WHERE WE MAY ACCESS THE MEMORY THAT HAS BEEN BLACKLISTED>

To debug kasan, time should be disabled.

LDREX / STREX need a dedicated exclusive monitor.


STACK OVERFLOWS AND KASAN : 
- kasan adds stack consumption on the kernel stack
	-> bad for stack overflows
	-> can be detected using stack guards.
	-> issue is : stack guard is written to in kasan, exception (hardfault/memfault)
			will occur
		-> processor will write to the stack
		-> will trap again
			-> PC will never be pushed to stack
			-> gdb will never show the backtrace.

Bad stack unwinding when entering kasan
	-> need to avoid function inside function, causes the debugger to incorrectly
       unwind the stack.
