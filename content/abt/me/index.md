Hola !

I am :
- Raphael Outhier.
- french.
- have a passion for system level programming.
- living in Texas.

Dates :
- 2015 -> 2019 : studied at an engineering school in Paris where I split my time between low level programming and building robots out of ducktape and prayers.
- 2020 -> 2021 : worked for ARM in Sophia Antipolis (France) as a CPU verification engineer.
- 2021 -> 2022 : worked for myself.
- 2022 -> now  : working for Apple as a platform kernel engineer.

Current work at AAPL :
- developing kernel drivers for Apple's next generation of chips for computers, phones, watches, TVs, and headsets.
- investigating HW bugs that occured on those chips, and finding what instructions a given CPU incorrectly executed so that the HW team can find out where the RTL bug is.

I have a lot of personal projects, and this website is about them.

Those projects revolve around :
- kernel development for microcontrollers.
- coming up with the fastest implementations of 2d/3d/4d computational geometry algorithms in the hope that someday I could have my own little solidworks-like CAD software. I have as of today never found the time to write on this part of my life, but if I do, I promisse to include an introduction to all the facinating math behind computational geometry.  
- automatic trading because who doesn't like the prospects of free money ?
- algorithmic optimization and assembly trickery, for the intellectual challenge.

That amounts to a lot of projects and code (over 1 million lines of pure C/C++/asm joy). As stated earlier, I am not authorized to publish any project because of my current job at Apple. But maybe that will change in some years, who knows.

In the meantime, the best I can do is to try to make good descriptive articles about those, and hope that you will find them interesting.
